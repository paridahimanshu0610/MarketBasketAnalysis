# Market Basket Analysis

## Introduction:
We've entered an age where computers often understand us better than we understand ourselves. Our devices have become incredibly powerful, capable of not only tracking our current activities but also predicting our future actions. One notable application of this AI capability is Market Basket Analysis, commonly used in retail stores. It predicts which additional items we are likely to purchase alongside the product we've bought, helping retailers make tailored recommendations.

## Project Details:
In this project, we utilize the Groceries dataset, containing 38,765 rows of purchase orders from grocery stores. The dataset consists of a single CSV file.

Data: Groceries_dataset.csv

In the datasets provided, I conducted an analysis using visualizations and employed the Apriori algorithm for rule mining. Previously, I had never pondered the reasons behind the arrangement of items in close proximity within a supermarket. I assumed it was solely for the convenience of customers, without realizing its significant business implications.

## Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Understanding the data using EDA techniques
3. Perform A-rule mining using Apriori algorithm
4. Visualizing the results of association between items
